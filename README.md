# BankingApp
This app allows users to:
 1) Enter an initial investment amount
 2) Enter a monthly deposit amount
 3) Enter an annual interest amount (compounded)
 4) Eneter a number of years

A nice feature of this app is that a user does not have to enter an additional monthly deposit amount and may choose to only make an initial deposit.
The simple display will show the user's year end balance as well as display the interest earned on both the initial deposit and any recurring deposit amount entered.
